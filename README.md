I would like to thank Erick Pogue for posting the template and instructions on how to create and host our own website through GitHub Pages. The experience was beneficial as I learned something new and became aware of the features GitHub provides to its users with this short exercise. I also want to credit our AI friend, GPT, for its detailed step-by-step tutorial on creating a website through GitHub and the template it provided for the desired prompt. Lastly, I want to thank GitHub for unveiling its spectrum of features, which any web developer would be glad to have. The features are easy to use, and it is always a good place to share and collaborate with developers.
